</p>

<p>Bayes Theorem is a way to get the real probabilities out of a scenario where true positives (TP), true negatives (TN) , false positives (FP) and false negatives (FN) exist. Rather than seeing a single event, we can see conditions.</p>

<p>We can also think of it as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
  <strong>P(true probability of an event) = P(true positive) / P(positive)</strong>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>read as ‘<em>the true probability of an event is equal to the probability of true positives divided by the chance of a positive result</em>‘. <strong>P(positive)</strong> is actually <strong>P(true positive) + P(false positive)</strong>, as the sum of the probabilities of true positives and false positives equals the probability of observing a positive.</p>

<p>Let’s take an example. There is a cancer test out there. If the patient has cancer, 90% of the times it will return positive result (a true positive). Suppose you took the cancer test, and it returns a positive result.</p>

<p>Does it mean you have 90% chance of having cancer?</p>

<p>You can’t tell, not without knowing 1) what is the probability of people having cancer 2) how many times the cancer test returns positive on a healthy human (false positives).</p>

<p>Now, if you are told that only 1% of the people in the world get cancer, and the cancer test actually returns a positive on a perfectly health human 17% of the time. Using the Bayes formula to help us:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>P(you have cancer, given the cancer test returns positive) = P(true positive) / P(positive)</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Remembering that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>P(positive) = P(true positive) + P(false positive) = P(TP) + P(FP)</strong> :</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And simplifying some notion, we have:</p>

<blockquote>
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>**P(cancer</td>
        <td>positive)**</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>= P(TP) / ( P(TP) + P(FP) )</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>**= (P(positive</td>
        <td>cancer) * P(cancer)) / ( P(positive</td>
        <td>cancer) * P(cancer) + P(positive</td>
        <td>no cancer) * P(no cancer) )**</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>**= (90% * 1%) / (90% * 1% + 17% * (1 – 1%))</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>= (90% * 1%) / (90% * 1% + 17% * 99%)</strong>**</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>= 5.07%</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As it turns out, in this case, you are not having 90% of really having cancer but 5.07% only. Why does the cancer test that can returns positive on people having cancer 90% of the time, actually means you only have 5.07% chance of really getting a cancer?</p>

<p>The intuition is : Even though the test is accurate on cancer patients, but the test get it wrong 17% of the times on healthy humans. Couldn’t you be likely part of the mistaken ones?</p>

<p>So, this is it! Bayes Theorem is just about correcting and measuring the real probabilities of an event given some conditions.</p>
