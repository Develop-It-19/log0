    <p>Sharing a piece of reply I have on the Kaggle forum <a href="http://www.kaggle.com/forums/t/5375/please-recommend-books-web-links-to-attain-skills-needed-to-take-part-in/28640#post28640">here</a>. If you like to see REAL machine learning code, try starting from <a href="http://www.chioka.in/kaggle-competition-solutions/">this solution collection</a> I have.</p>

<p>Here are my suggestions for people who are not very mathematical (i.e. you don’t breathe very difficult mathematics day-to-day), but more from a software engineer background. If you’re a very math guy (who can read without any code and start doing magic), this might not be the best approach for learning machine learning.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>With absolutely no background, I highly recommend to begin with Andrew’s Ng “Machine Learning” course on Coursera, which is taught and geared towards an audience with no machine learning background.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/ml" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://www.coursera.org/course/ml</a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Recently I found that the Python machine learning library Sci-kit learn User Guide is very informative, with *runnable code*, which you can immediately see to the effects of what you are doing. I also recommend that a lot if you would prefer coding to learn (I need code to learn). Also, this library is also very easy to use and very powerful, which is the one I am using now primarily. However, you should approach only picking code examples and not aim to understand everything just reading once. Dive deeper when you need it on certain topics.</p>

<p><a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html</a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Next, for Kaggle-specific competitions, Zygmunt’s (Foxtrot) blog at <a href="http://www.fastml.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">FastML</a> also contains a lot of examples (though it might not run now due to the new submission rules) which brings you up to speed. You may also find a lot of code that other players shared in various competitions this various Kaggle competition forums, which is also good to get up to speed.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fastml.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.fastml.com</a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>By now, you should be more than just unable to submit (I was there). I would suggest that you also start adding and fortifying theoretical and mathematical basics from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Tom-M-Mitchell/dp/0070428077" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Machine Learning</a> by Tom Mitchell, which is a rather readable book (compared to other books, see below).</p>

<p>I know that the posters above recommended books like “The Elements of Statistical Learning”, or even I have books like “Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning”, “Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning”, I felt these are more mathematical and unless you are really natural at it, I believe you will find it less readable than Machine Learning by Tom Mitchell. Do note that this book is a classic and has not been updated for a bit (planned to), some recent adopted approaches like Random Forests are not included.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Tom-M-Mitchell/dp/0070428077" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Machine Learning – Tom Mitchell</a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>If you prefer a programmer’s introduction to machine learning, I believe you can try <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596529321.do" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Programming Collective Intelligence</a> which is geared towards software developers, less mathematics.</p>

<p><a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596529321.do" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Programming Collective Intelligence</a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Like any other principles like web application development, this needs practice and deep understanding, and I think you will need datasets to start with for different examples, Sci-kit Learn has some sample datasets included, but you may also find it <a href="http://www.kaggle.com/forums/t/5375/archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">UCI Machine Learning Repository</a>, if you feel adventurous.</p>

<p><a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">UCI Machine Learning Repository</a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>I have been in this position of no help and honestly the introduction is not easy. I really owe Zygmunt’s (Foxtrot) for the solution code to start with, I strongly suggest you to go check it out along side having Andrew Ng’s course. Thank you Zygmunt again (if you happen to read this). =]</p>
