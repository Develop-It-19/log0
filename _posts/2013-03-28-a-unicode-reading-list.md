# Introduction

It makes you a better developer if you know the basis of UTF-8, UTF-16, Unicode, BIG5, GB2312 and things inside-out. As such, I am curating a list of articles which would be helpful to get you started.

This will be a growing list.

# Basics

[The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets (No Excuses!)](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html)Â &#8211; One of the best intro articles to unicode

# Python

Python 2.x has not been the friendliest introduction to unicode, so some readings:

[Unicode In Python, Completely Demystified](http://farmdev.com/talks/unicode/) &#8211; Confused about UnicodeEncodeError and UnicodeDecodeError? No longer

[Making Sense of Python Unicode](http://lobstertech.com/python_unicode.html) &#8211; More examples in Python with unicode

# Other Topics

[Unicode Collation Algorithm](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr10/#Main_Algorithm) &#8211; How locale-aware string comparisons work
