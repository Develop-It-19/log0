<p>This paper, <a href="http://robotics.stanford.edu/~ronnyk/accEst.pdf">A Study of CrossValidation and Bootstrap for Accuracy Estimation and Model Selection</a>, by Rohavi 1995 explains how when in the older past, researchers tend to use Leave-one-out cross validation (wiki please), and how K-fold (k=10/20, though I use 5 generally) actually yield better results.</p>
