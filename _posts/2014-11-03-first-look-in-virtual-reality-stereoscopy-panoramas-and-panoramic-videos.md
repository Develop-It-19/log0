I got the <a href="http://g.co/cardboard" target="_blank">Google Cardboard</a> recently, and I&#8217;m playing with it. Google Cardboard is a very simple piece of gadget that turns your phone into a virtual reality headset. It was released in <a href="https://www.google.com/events/io" target="_blank">Google I/O 2014</a>. If you have an Android phone, you can download the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.samples.apps.cardboarddemo&hl=en" target="_blank">Cardboard application</a> which has works very well with Google Cardboard.

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-505" src="http://www.chioka.in/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/google-cardboard.jpg" alt="google cardboard" width="490" height="490" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/google-cardboard.jpg 490w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/11/google-cardboard-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" />](http://www.chioka.in/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/google-cardboard.jpg)

One of the function provided by the Cardboard application is viewing Photo Sphere in a virtual reality setting. <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/about/contribute/photosphere/" target="_blank">Photo Sphere</a> is a kind of photo that is (360 x 180) degrees panoramic, that is, not just 360 degrees horizontally, but also you can look up and down. It is very cool.

Check out <a href="http://360gigapixels.com/tokyo-tower-panorama-photo/" target="_blank">this panoramic view</a> from Tokyo Tower by 360cities for something similar in concept.

Here is the cool thing:  The Cardboard application pushes the Photo Sphere further by putting you in an immersive experience. The experience is as if you&#8217;re at the scene looking around _in person_. Yes, I know it&#8217;s not stereoscopic, but hey!

I know I know! It&#8217;s hard to visualize that. You can only really experience that when you acutally play with a virtual reality headset. In that case, I highly encourage you to get a virtual reality headset like Google Cardboard, or even build one yourself! =]

# Panoramic Videos!

However, I am actually more excited not just with photos, but videos. Check these out:

  * <a href="http://www.bubl.io/experiences/648c1828-17dc-48b6-b7c1-4f859389f66b" target="_blank">Panoramic video of a tour around NYC in a Taxi</a>
  * <a href="http://www.bubl.io/experiences/ca20efe4-925e-458f-826f-4c7cb77d2e39" target="_blank">Panoramic video of skydiving in Toronto</a>

Google Cardboard doesn&#8217;t work with these though. So I haven&#8217;t try viewing it in a Cardboard for now. I will hope to try it out.

# Stereoscopic Panoramic Videos?!!

What if the panoramic videos are stereoscopic? WOW!

Though, I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re there yet. This area seems to be still in its infancy. The closest thing I&#8217;ve seen is the <a href="http://www.panocam3d.com/" target="_blank">Panocam3D</a>, which is a hexagonal device with 2 cameras on each direction.

The idea to capture stereoscopic panoramic videos is explained <a href="http://www.video-stitch.com/whats-stereographic-3d-panoramic-video/" target="_blank">here</a>, though this may not be the ideal solution since we still only get 360 degrees and not (360 x 180) degrees.

# Resources

I studied a little bit about stereoscopy, panoramas and panoramic videos. Here are some resources if you&#8217;re interested (and notes for myself).

Demonstration of panoramic images and videos:

  * <a href="http://video.airpano.com/Video-Dubai-UAE/video-normal-en.html" target="_blank">Dubai panoramic video by AirPano</a> &#8211; They have a lot of other panoramic videos too.
  * <a href="http://www.360cities.net/" target="_blank">360cities</a> &#8211; Panoramic images of many cities in the world.

Devices that can capture (360 x 180) degrees panorama:

  * <a href="http://www.bublcam.com" target="_blank">Bublcam</a> &#8211; A spherical device with multiple cameras on it. The above videos are from Bublcam. It looks a pixelated but still acceptable. Not available for sale yet.
  * <a href="http://geonaute.com" target="_blank">Geonaute</a> &#8211; Another one that looks pretty good, though the demos seem to see the apex (the top area where the corners join) seems to be a bit badly stitched. Still very good.
  * <a href="http://www.360heros.com/" target="_blank">360heros</a> &#8211; Actually it&#8217;s a gadget to clamp together 6 GoPro cameras in all 6 directions (front back left right up and down). I would think getting the Bublcam and Geonaute may be better, but GoPro probably have better resolution.

Devices that can capture (360) degrees panorama:

  * <a href="http://www.gopano.com" target="_blank">GoPano </a>&#8211; A special lens attachable to iPhone that allows you to take panoramas and panoramic videos. It works by having a 360 degree lens and bend the light into the iPhone camera. Works for iPhone only. 360 degrees horizontally only.
  * <a href="http://kogeto.com/" target="_blank">Kageto</a> &#8211; A company manufacturing the Dot, Lucy, and Jo. They are successive versions of a special lens attachable to iPhone or Android to take panoramas and panoramic videos. Similar to GoPano, 360 degrees horizontally only.
  * <a href="www.bubblescope.com" target="_blank">BubbleScope</a> &#8211; Another attachable lens to iPhone for capturing panoramas and panoramic videos. Similar to GoPano, 360 degrees horizontally only.

Software Apps that takes panoramic pictures without using another external cam/device. Apparently, you cannot do panoramic videos from these (it&#8217;ll look like a mess):

  * <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/about/contribute/photosphere/" target="_blank">Photo Sphere</a> &#8211; Take panoramic photos using built-in Android Camera app developed by Google.
  * <a href="http://www.photosynth.net" target="_blank">Photo Synth</a> &#8211; Take panoramic photos using this app developed by Microsoft Research.

Readings about stereoscopy, panoramas, and panoramic videos;

  * <a href="http://nzphoto.tripod.com/stereo/3dtake/" target="_blank">Principles of stereoscopic photography using an ordinary camera</a> &#8211; How to shoot your own stereoscopic photo. Seems like a very old page but the ideas are very clearly explained.
  * <a href="http://www.video-stitch.com/whats-stereographic-3d-panoramic-video/" target="_blank">What’s up with stereographic 3D panoramic video</a> &#8211; An article that talks about how to shoot stereoscopic panoramic videos, in theory. We don&#8217;t know if this is the best way though.
  * <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereoscopy" target="_blank">Stereoscopy on Wikipedia</a> &#8211; As usual, Wikipedia is a good place to look at.
  * <a href="http://photocreations.ca/3D/index.html" target="_blank">PhotoCreation</a> &#8211; Apparently someone very enthusiastic in stereoscopic panoramic videos.
